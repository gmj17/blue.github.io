            I am very grateful for wearing the hat the day I met when I caught your attention jeje. But in all seriousness, the moment we met I fell in love with your soft voice. You said I looked and sounded like if I wasn’t from here, but you sounded like a sweet angel that I had never heard. From the get-go I felt comfort just by your voice. Your smile was unbelievably perfect and I fell in love with you. I am also very glad you felt safe with me since that very night. We clicked. What we were had gone slow, but we always kept in contact and were each others comfort throughout the year. Towards the end of senior year, unfortunately we stopped talking. I was thinking about you every day because you had become part of my daily routine(I know I know I wasn’t the best at communicating then) but after a month of no contact we started talking again after being thousands of miles separated from one another.

            We spent all summer texting once again and we both returned home around the same time. Not knowing what exactly was going to happen with us. The universe aligned it so that we would meet once again in a summer camp at school that we had no idea any of us were at. Till I saw your pretty face once again. I still think about that jeje. Again, it was a little slow but we went on to become closer and closer. We started being around each other every day and fortunately we became something more, something wonderful. We had fallen in love like kids. We built great memories with one another. I remember all our laughs, especially those uncontrollable ones. Every single time we made each other happy and proud of one another. We became each others rock.

            Fast forward to second semester, it wasn’t as pretty as we anticipated it but we both were still sure of each other after all the ups and downs. You’ve been nothing but perfection my love even after I messed up a few times you still wanted this and we’re willing to keep trying. I won’t let you down my sweet angel. We’re going to paint a very pretty picture with our lives.  I will continue fighting for you every single day even that you’re already mine. I will keep trying to win you over. You deserve the best and I want to be the best for you, for us. I love you 888.
